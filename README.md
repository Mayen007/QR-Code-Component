## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, alt attributes)

### What I Learned

This project reinforced my understanding of HTML and CSS, and I also gained new insights into making content more accessible. Key points include:

- Adding ARIA attributes like `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` for screen readers.
- Using CSS custom properties for color variables to maintain a consistent theme.
- Implementing a responsive layout without using frameworks or Flexbox.

Example of CSS for responsive layout and styling:

```css
.container {
  max-width: 375px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 1rem;
  background-color: var(--white);
  border-radius: 17px;
  position: relative;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Continued Development

For future projects, I want to keep improving my understanding of responsive design and focus more on accessible practices. I also aim to explore CSS Grid to expand my layout options.
